# skydive
cfd analysis of ballute geometry during skydive. the purpose of this model
is the evaluation of the mesh sensitivity and getting the basic functionality right.
the correctness of the model is evaluated by the terminal velocity measured during a 
skydive with the ballute. 

## current to dos
* mesh the full domain (no vertical symmetry)
* get the yPlus values right (30 < y+ < 300)
*
